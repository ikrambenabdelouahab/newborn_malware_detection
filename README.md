# newborn_malware_detection
Detect next generation of malware using machine learning algorithms

This is the implementation of Paper : ***"A new approach to detect next generation of malware based on machine learning"***

We use Malimg database, so you find extracted features in npy files: *train_features, test_features and newborn_features.*
we also provide pretrained models in folder: *Trained_models*
This code was written in Python2.7.

***Database split : (24 and 25 are the newborn family in our simulation)***
